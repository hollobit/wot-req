Style guide to contributors:
============================
- this document uses ReSpec, see
  http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/ReSpec.js/documentation.html
- use 80 characters wide lines, whenever possible (except long links)
- keep sections 2 empty lines apart
- put comments in front of sections, for better readability with syntax coloring
  editors
- use indentation with care: it may improve readability, but at the expense of
  line lenght
- when descriptions of attributes is short, use the <dd> elements even when
  the text also contains conformance statements (e.g. MUST, SHOULD, MAY).
  No use repeating the same information in a separate paragraph.

      <p>Web of Things(WoT) system is the service model between two or more entities that do not

      <p>The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Web Architecture</a></code> is a architecture 
    	in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers as defined in [[!webarch]]

	   <p>The <code>WoT Gateway(or Broker)</code> is that has a role for integrating and exposing the devices to the web. This broker has responsibility for communicating between the user of the WoT (e.g., web clients, applications) and
	   fully-fledged devices as well as constrained devices as defined in [[!Y.2063]]

<!--
== WoT Trusted Application == 

* The WoT system may handle service request responses for trusted WoT Applications by allowing streamlined
authentication procedures for these applications.

* The WoT system may support trusted applications, that are applications pre-validated by the M2M system.

== Mobility == 

* If the underlying network supports seamless mobility and roaming, the WoT System shall be able to use such
mechanisms.

== Communications integrity == 

* The WoT System shall be able to support mechanisms to assure communications integrity for WoT services.

== Device/Gateway integrity check == 

* The WoT System shall support WoT enabled Device and WoT Gateway integrity check.

== Continuous connectivity == 

* The WoT System shall support continuous connectivity, for WoT applications requesting the same WoT service on a regular and continuous basis. This continuous connectivity may be de-activated upon request of the Application or by an internal mechanism in the WoT system.

== Confirm == 

* The WoT System shall support mechanisms to confirm messages. A message may be unconfirmed, confirmed or
transaction controlled.

== Priority == 

* The WoT System shall support the management of priority levels of the services and communications services.
Ongoing communications may be interrupted in order to serve a flow with higher priority (i.e. pre-emption).

== Logging == 

* Messaging and transactions requiring non-repudiation shall be capable of being logged. 

* Important events (e.g. received information from the WoT enabled Device or WoT Gateway is faulty, unsuccessful installation attempt from the WoT enabled Device or WoT Gateway, service not operating, etc.) may be logged together with diagnostic information. 

* Logs shall be retrievable upon request.

== Anonymity == 

* The WoT System shall be able to support Anonymity. If anonymity is requested by an WoT Application from the
WoT enabled Device side and the request is accepted by the network, the network infrastructure will hide the identity and the location of the requestor, subject to regulatory requirements.

== Time Stamp == 

* The WoT System shall be able to support accurate and secure and trusted time stamping. WoT enabled Devices and WoT Gateways may support accurate and secure and trusted time stamping.

== Device/Gateway failure robustness == 

After a non-destructive failure, e.g. after a power supply outage, a WoT enabled Device or Gateway should immediately return in a full operating state autonomously, after performing the appropriate initialization e.g. integrity check if supported.

== Radio transmission activity indication and control == 

* The radio transmitting parts (e.g. GSM/GPRS) of the WoT enabled Device/Gateway should be able to provide (if required by particular applications e.g. eHealth) a real-time indication of radio transmission activity to the application on the WoT enabled Device/Gateway, and may be instructed real-time by the application on the WoT enabled Device/Gateway to suspend/resume the radio transmission activity.

== Operator telco capabilities exposure == 

* The WoT interface to the external WoT applications shall enable the exposition of telco operator capabilities
(e.g. SMS, USSD, localization, subscription configuration, authentication (e.g. Generic Bootstrapping Architecture), etc). 

* The WoT service platform shall be able to provide access to non-WoT resources abstracted as WoT resources to
provide to the applications a consistent use of the WoT capabilities.

== Location reporting support == 

* The WoT System shall be able to report WoT enabled Device/Gateway location to WoT applications when this information is available.
