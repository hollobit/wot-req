Style guide to contributors:
============================
- this document uses ReSpec, see
  http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/ReSpec.js/documentation.html
- use 80 characters wide lines, whenever possible (except long links)
- keep sections 2 empty lines apart
- put comments in front of sections, for better readability with syntax coloring
  editors
- use indentation with care: it may improve readability, but at the expense of
  line lenght
- when descriptions of attributes is short, use the <dd> elements even when
  the text also contains conformance statements (e.g. MUST, SHOULD, MAY).
  No use repeating the same information in a separate paragraph.

      <p>The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Web Architecture</a></code> is a architecture 
    	in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers as defined in [[!webarch]]

	   <p>The <code>WoT Gateway(or Broker)</code> has the role of integrating and exposing the devices to the web. This broker has responsibility for communicating between the user of the WoT (e.g., web clients, applications) and
	   fully-fledged devices as well as constrained devices as defined in [[!Y.2063]]

				<li>The WoT System shall be able to allow communication between WoT Applications in the Network and Applications
Domain, and the WoT enabled Device or WoT Gateway

			</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h4>Message Delivery for sleeping devices</h4> 
			<ul>

				</ul>
			</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Message transmission scheduling</h4> 
			<ul>
				<li>The WoT System shall be able to manage the scheduling of network access and of messaging.
				<li>The M2M System shall be aware of the scheduling delay tolerance of the WoT Application.
				</ul>
			</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Communication with devices behind a WoT gateway</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The WoT System should be able to communicate with Devices behind a WoT gateway.
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h4>Communication failure notification</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>WoT Applications, requesting reliable delivery of a message, shall be notified of any failures to deliver the message.
			</ul>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h4>Scalability</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The WoT System shall be scalable in terms of number of WoT Resources.
				</ul>
			</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Abstraction of technologies heterogeneity</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The WoT Gateway may be capable of interfacing to various WoT Area Network technologies.
			<ul>
			</section>
			
		<section>
			<h4>WoT Service Capabilities discovery and registration</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>The WoT System shall support mechanisms to allow WoT Applications to discover WoT Service Capabilities offered to them.
				<li>Additionally the WoT enabled Device and WoT Gateway shall support mechanisms to allow the registration of its WoT Service Capabilities to the WoT system.
				</ul>
			</section>
	
		<section>
			<h4>WoT Trusted Application</h4> 
			<ul>
				<li>The WoT system may handle service request responses for trusted WoT Applications by allowing streamlined
authentication procedures for these applications.
				<li>The WoT system may support trusted applications, that are applications pre-validated by the M2M system.
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section>
			<h4>Mobility</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>If the underlying network supports seamless mobility and roaming, the WoT System shall be able to use such
mechanisms.
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h4>Communications integrity</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The WoT System shall be able to support mechanisms to assure communications integrity for WoT services.

	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h4>Continuous connectivity</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The WoT System shall support continuous connectivity, for WoT applications requesting the same WoT service on a regular and continuous basis. This continuous connectivity may be de-activated upon request of the Application or by an internal mechanism in the WoT system.
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h4>Confirm</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The WoT System shall support mechanisms to confirm messages. A message may be unconfirmed, confirmed or
transaction controlled.
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4>Priority</h4>
		<ul>

		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h4>Logging</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li>Messaging and transactions requiring non-repudiation shall be capable of being logged.

			<li>Logs shall be retrievable upon request.
			</ul>
		</section>

		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h4>Radio transmission activity indication and control</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The radio transmitting parts (e.g. GSM/GPRS) of the WoT enabled Device/Gateway should be able to provide (if required by particular applications e.g. eHealth) a real-time indication of radio transmission activity to the application on the WoT enabled Device/Gateway, and may be instructed real-time by the application on the WoT enabled Device/Gateway to suspend/resume the radio transmission activity.
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h4>Operator telco capabilities exposure</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The WoT interface to the external WoT applications shall enable the exposition of telco operator capabilities
(e.g. SMS, USSD, localization, subscription configuration, authentication (e.g. Generic Bootstrapping Architecture), etc). 
			<li>The WoT service platform shall be able to provide access to non-WoT resources abstracted as WoT resources to
provide to the applications a consistent use of the WoT capabilities.
		</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h4>Location reporting support</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The WoT System shall be able to report WoT enabled Device/Gateway location to WoT applications when this information is available.
